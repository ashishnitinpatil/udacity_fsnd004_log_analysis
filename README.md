Project: Log Analysis (nd004)
=============================
This is part of the project submission under the Full Stack Nano Degree program of Udacity, authored by Ashish Nitin Patil.

Project brief
-------------
- The [report.py](/report.py) generates the 3 reports, viz.:
  - Most popular articles of all time
  - Most popular article authors of all time
  - Days when more than 1% of requests lead to errors
- The [report.txt](/report.txt) contains the report based on the given dataset
- All SQL queries are optimized and the reporting has been standardised, neatly separating the result fetching and the formatting, thus making it easy to create additional reports in the future

Requirements
------------
- You will need the virtual machine setup (or just postgres with python3 and psycopg2)
- along with the [dataset](/newsdata.zip) (tables articles, authors, log in news db)
